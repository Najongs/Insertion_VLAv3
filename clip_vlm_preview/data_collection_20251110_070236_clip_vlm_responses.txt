Instruction:
This is a robot hand-eye view with a sensorized needle. Focus on the needle tip and its interaction with the environment. Analyze the following aspects:\n1. Proximity: How close is the needle tip to the intended target and other nearby objects? (e.g., far, near, touching).\n2. Contact State: Is the needle tip making contact with any surface? Describe the nature of the contact (e.g., no contact, light touch, firm press, inserting).\n3. Certainty: How certain are you about the contact state? (High, Medium, Low).

Global Sample #114 (Last 20% idx: 0, VLM idx: 114)
================================================================================

VLM Response:
1. **Proximity**: The needle tip appears to be very close to the intended target, which is the red circular object. It seems to be in the process of either touching or inserting into the red object.

2. **Contact State**: The needle tip is making contact with the red circular object. The nature of the contact is a firm press, as indicated by the slight indentation visible on the surface of the red object where the needle has made contact.

3. **Certainty**: I am quite certain about the contact state. The indentation and the position of the needle suggest that it is firmly pressing against the red object. There is no indication of any other interaction with the surrounding objects, such as the blue, green, or yellow circles, which further supports the certainty of the contact with the red object.

Global Sample #116 (Last 20% idx: 2, VLM idx: 116)
================================================================================

Image: View5/OAK_1762725785.420.jpg

VLM Response:
1. **Proximity**: The needle tip appears to be very close to the intended target, which is the red circle. It seems to be in direct contact with the red circle.

2. **Contact State**: The needle tip is making contact with the red circle. The nature of the contact is a firm press, as indicated by the slight indentation or deformation of the red circle around the point of contact.

3. **Certainty**: I am quite certain about the contact state. The visual cues such as the indentation and the precise positioning of the needle suggest that it has made a firm press on the red circle.

Global Sample #122 (Last 20% idx: 8, VLM idx: 122)
================================================================================

Image: View5/OAK_1762725786.926.jpg

VLM Response:
1. **Proximity**: The needle tip appears to be very close to the intended target, which is the red circle. It seems to be in direct contact with the red circle.

2. **Contact State**: The needle tip is making contact with the red circle. The nature of the contact is a firm press, as indicated by the slight indentation or deformation of the red circle around the point of contact.

3. **Certainty**: I am quite certain about the contact state. The visual evidence of the indentation and the proximity suggest that the needle has indeed made contact with the red circle.

Global Sample #125 (Last 20% idx: 11, VLM idx: 125)
================================================================================

Image: View5/OAK_1762725787.671.jpg

VLM Response:
1. **Proximity**: The needle tip is very close to the red circular target. It appears to be in direct contact with the center of the red circle.

2. **Contact State**: The needle tip is making a firm press against the red circular target. There is no indication of light touch or insertion; it is clearly in contact with the surface.

3. **Certainty**: I am quite certain about the contact state. The needle tip is firmly pressing against the red circle, which suggests a high level of certainty that the needle is in contact with the target.

Global Sample #134 (Last 20% idx: 20, VLM idx: 134)
================================================================================

Image: View5/OAK_1762725789.923.jpg

VLM Response:
1. **Proximity**: The needle tip is very close to the red circular object, which appears to be the intended target. It seems that the needle is almost in contact with the red circle.

2. **Contact State**: The needle tip is making contact with the red circular object. The nature of the contact is a firm press, as indicated by the slight indentation or deformation of the red circle.

3. **Certainty**: I am quite certain about the contact state. The needle's position and the visible deformation of the red circle suggest a firm press. There is no indication of any other objects or surfaces interacting with the needle, so the certainty is high.

Global Sample #137 (Last 20% idx: 23, VLM idx: 137)
================================================================================

Image: View5/OAK_1762725790.670.jpg

VLM Response:
1. **Proximity**: The needle tip is very close to the red circular target. It appears to be touching or very near to the center of the red circle.

2. **Contact State**: The needle tip is making contact with the red circular target. The nature of the contact seems to be a firm press, as indicated by the slight indentation in the red circle where the needle has made contact.

3. **Certainty**: I am quite certain about the contact state. The indentation in the red circle and the proximity of the needle tip to the target suggest that the needle has indeed made contact firmly.
