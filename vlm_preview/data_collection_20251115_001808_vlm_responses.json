The eye trocar is a small silver hole in the silicone eye model phantom.\n\n#### 3) Required Adjustment Direction:\nTo align the needle tip correctly for insertion into the eye trocar, the needle should be adjusted so that its tip is directly over the center of the eye trocar. This requires a slight downward and forward tilt of the needle.\n\n#### 4) Distance with Eye Trocar and Needle Tip Point:\nThe exact distance between the needle tip and the eye trocar cannot be determined from the provided images alone. However, based on the alignment observed, the needle tip is positioned close enough to the eye trocar to allow for insertion.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Target Visibility:** The eye trocar is clearly visible as a small silver hole in the silicone eye model phantom.\n- **Needle Alignment:** The needle tip is aligned towards the center of the eye trocar.\n- **Required Adjustment Direction:** A slight downward and forward tilt of"
